			<p>Unfortunatly I don't have access to an SLS printer right now, and it didn't make sense in this project to get these parts professionally made, so instead I took the time to sand and polish some of the FDM printed parts to give the device a really nice clean look. </p>

			<p>I havent exactly decided how to make the diffuser, right now I have two options. The first choice is to mill it out of HDPE or another translucent plastic. Im leaning toward this option becuase I think it will come out looking really good, but I'm not sure how translucent the HDPE that I have is. The second option is to cast it out of polyurethane resin. I think this will still look nice, but I'm afraid there will be a lot of little bubbles. I think I might test both and see which one comes out better.</p>

			<p>The part I am most excited about in this project is the decals. To make them, the designs are printed on a normal sticker paper, laminated with clear vinyl, then cutout using a Cricut machine.</p>
