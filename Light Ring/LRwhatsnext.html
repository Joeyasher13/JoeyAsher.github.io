            <p>	I am thinking right now about adapting, or making a version of this light ring into a speed flash. Right now it is setup only to have a constant brightness, but it dawned on me today that it might be possible, and dare I say easy, to adapt this design into a functional speed flash. I am not sure if how big of a challange it will be to get the timing correct, though it seams pretty straight forward.</p>

            <p>I'm going to kick things off by running some tests on the LED boards I already have. If I decide to go ahead with this, I'll whip up another control board that can handle the speed flash part. Then, when I'm ready to get more boards made, I'll order both the original controller board and the one with speed flash built in.</p>
