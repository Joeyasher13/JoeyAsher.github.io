            <p>The electronics for this project were relatively straightforward. As mentioned before, the light ring was initially designed for use in an underwater ROV, but I adapted it to be as versatile as possible for various projects like this. The light ring receives I2C messages from a host and operates within a voltage range of 12V to 16.8V. This board uses an ATtiny414 microcontroller.</p>

            <p> The only other electronic component needed for this project was a small PCB equipped with an encoder, and the ability to send control signals to the light ring using an ATtiny214 microcontroller. This board is powered by a 12V-16.8V supply, making it compatible with both a 4S LiPo battery and a 12V AC/DC wall adapter. This board delievers both power and control signals to the LED ring.</p>
